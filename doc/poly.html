<h1><i>Poly</i> - a polynomial desk-calculator</h1>

<p><i>Poly</i> is a simple programming language for
manipulating polynomials.  For example, here is a program
to calculate and print the first 10 Chebyshev polynomials,
using the recurrence <i>T</i><sub><i>n</i>+1</sub>(<i>x</i>)=2<i>x</i><i>T</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>(<i>x</i>)-<i>T</i><sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>(<i>x</i>).
<pre>
	t0=1;
	print t0;
	t1=x;
	print t1;
	for(i=2;i!=10;i++){
		t2=2*x*t1-t0
		print t2
		t0=t1
		t1=t2
	};
</pre>

And here is its output

<pre>
	1
	x
	-1+2*x^2
	-3*x+4*x^3
	1-8*x^2+8*x^4
	5*x-20*x^3+16*x^5
	-1+18*x^2-48*x^4+32*x^6
	-7*x+56*x^3-112*x^5+64*x^7
	1-32*x^2+160*x^4-256*x^6+128*x^8
	9*x-120*x^3+432*x^5-576*x^7+256*x^9
</pre>

Except for the peculiar placement of semicolons, this code should be
immediately understandable to <i>C</i>, or especially <i>awk</i>, programmers.

<p>The language is extremely simple.  The only statement types
assign values to variables, print values out and control
execution using <tt>if</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, <tt>while</tt>, <tt>break</tt>
and <tt>continue</tt> statements reminiscent of <i>C</i> or <i>awk</i>.

<h4>Lexical structure</h4>

<p>Few will be surprised to learn that <i>poly</i> breaks its input
into a stream of tokens that are then parsed by a <i>yacc</i> grammar.
The resulting parse trees are passed to an interpreter that does the
appropriate computation.  A complete grammar is given at the end
of this document.

<p>White space and comments serve to separate
tokens, and are otherwise ignored.  A comment begins with the sharp
sign <tt>#</tt> and continues to the end of the line.

<p>There are five main classes of tokens: names, reserved words, numbers,
strings and punctuation.
Names and key words are sequences of upper and lower-case letters,
underscores and digits, the first of which must not be a digit.  The
two cases are not equivalent, so <tt>X0</tt> and <tt>x0</tt>
are two different names.  The reserved words are

<pre>
	break	coef	continue
	deg	diff	do
	else	for	if
	int	print	while
</pre>

These may not be used as names.

<p>A number is a sequence of one or more digits, possibly containing a
decimal point, and possibly followed by an <tt>e</tt> or <tt>E</tt>
and an optionally signed string of one or more digits.  Examples are

<pre>
	137			<!-- reciprocal of fine structure constant --> 
	.45359237		<!-- pounds in a kilogram --> 
	3.14159265358979323846	<!-- pi --> 
	6.022169e+23		<!-- avogadro's number --> 
	1.6021917E-19		<!-- electron charge, in coulombs --> 
</pre>

<p>A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by double-quotes,
like <tt>"Result:&nbsp;%p\n"</tt>.
In strings, <tt>\n</tt>, <tt>\b</tt>, <tt>\r</tt>, <tt>\t</tt>, <tt>\0</tt>
and <tt>\\</tt> are escapes for newline, backspace,
carriage return, tab, nul and backslash.  Strings are only used to specify a
format in <tt>print</tt> statements.

<p>The punctuation tokens recognized by <i>poly</i> are

<pre>
	-	--	+	++
	*	/	=	==
	<	<=	>	>=
	^	'	,	;
	[	]	(	)
	{	}
</pre>

<h4>Expressions</h4>

<p>The value of every expression is a multivariate polynomial with
floating-point coefficients.  Someday I want to rewrite <i>poly</i>
to use arbitrary-precision rational coefficients.

<p>The simplest expressions are just numbers or names.  Depending on
whether or not a name has previously been given a value (by an assignment
statement, see below) it either stands for that value, or is a variable
in a polynomial.  Thus the following sequence
<pre>
	print x;
	x=y;
	print x;
</pre>
prints
<pre>
	x
	y
</pre>
At the first <tt>print</tt>, <tt>x</tt> has not yet been given a value,
so the output is the first-degree polynomial <i>x</i>.  After the assignment
<tt>x=y</tt>, <tt>x</tt> has a value, which the second <tt>print</tt> disgorges.

<p>Having assigned a value to <tt>x</tt>, we may still wish to refer to
the polynomial <i>x</i>.  We can do so by writing <tt>'x</tt>.  The quote
prevents <tt>x</tt>'s value from being substituted for it.  Thus, the way
to erase the definition of a variable is to write <tt>x='x;</tt>

<p>Operators in expressions should mostly be familiar to C
programmers.  The arithmetic operators <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>,
(both binary and unary) <tt>*</tt> and <tt>/</tt> work as expected,
with the caveat that the right operand of <tt>/</tt> must be a
constant - I haven't implemented more general polynomial division,
and in any case the result could not be guaranteed to be a polynomial.
There is an exponentiation operator <tt>^</tt>, which is right-associative
and higher precedence than <tt>*</tt> and <tt>/</tt>.  Of course, the exponent
must be a non-negative integer, since the system cannot represent values
that are not polynomials.
<i>Poly</i> also has an almost complete suite of relational and logical
operators.  The logical values <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> are represented
by the constant polynomials 1 and 0.  As an operand of a logical operator,
any non-zero polynomial is taken to be <b>true</b>.
Relational operators
<tt>&lt;=</tt>,
<tt>&lt;</tt>,
<tt>&gt;=</tt>,
<tt>&gt;</tt>,
<tt>==</tt>,
<tt>!=</tt>
work by subtracting their two operands.
If the difference is a constant, <i>poly</i> does the appropriate sign test
on the result.  Otherwise, the operation's value is <b>false</b>.
The logical operators <tt>||</tt> and
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> work as in C.  Logical not is inexplicably missing;
<tt>B==0</tt> will have to substitute.

<p><i>Poly</i> has a fairly powerful substitution operator that can substitute
any polynomial for each of several variables.  For example,
<pre>
	print (x^5)[x=x+1];
</pre>
substitutes <i>x</i>+1 for <i>x</i> in <i>x</i><sup>5</sup>, giving (<i>x</i>+1)<sup>5</sup>, and prints the result:
<pre>
	1+5*x+10*x^2+10*x^3+5*x^4+x^5
</pre>
(The parentheses are required in the above example because the precedence
of the <tt>[</tt>...<tt>]</tt> operator is higher than <tt>^</tt>.  Leave
them out and it just does the substitution on <tt>5</tt>.)

<p>Substitutions for more than one variable are done simultaneously.
Thus this input
<pre>
	print (x+y^2)[x=y,y=x];
	print (x+y^2)[x=y][y=x];
</pre>
prints
<pre>
	y+x^2
	x+x^2
</pre>
The first line swaps <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> while the
second changes <tt>x</tt> to <tt>y</tt> giving <tt>y+y^2</tt>
and then changes all the <tt>y</tt>'s back to <tt>x</tt>'s.
<p><i>Poly</i> has several built-in functions.
These are
<ul>
<li><tt>int&nbsp;</tt> constructs the indefinite integral of
its first argument with respect to its second, which must be the name
of a variable.  Each application of <tt>int</tt> introduces a new
constant of integration.
<li><tt>diff</tt> takes the derivative of its first argument with respect
to its second, which must be the name of a variable.
<li><tt>deg&nbsp;</tt> examines its first argument for occurrences
of its second argument, which must be the name of a variable, and
returns the highest exponent with which it occurs.
<li><tt>coef</tt>
</ul>

<h4>Statements</h4>

<p>The <tt>poly</tt> grammar is designed so that statements are self-delimiting.
<i>Poly</i> can always tell when a new statement is beginning, without the
aid of an explicit statement delimiter.  Unfortunately,
it can't tell that a statement has ended before reading the first token
of the following statement.  For example when you type
<tt>print&nbsp;(x+1)^5</tt>,
<i>poly</i> can't tell that you're not going to continue on the
next line with <tt>+y^4</tt>,
so it has to just sit and wait for you to type more.  Therefore, at the
top level (only!), statements must be terminated with a semicolon.
This accounts for the odd look of the example in the introduction,
where the <tt>for</tt> loop ends with a semicolon, but none of the
statements within its body do.  I wish I knew a way to deal
with this that simultaneously made life easier for the user and
didn't tie the lexical and parsing parts of the program in knots.

<p><i>Poly</i> has only a few statement types, some of which appeared
undescribed in the examples above.  The simplest is the <tt>print</tt>
statement, which appears in two forms:
<pre>
	print (x+1)^5;
	print "Answer: %p; %p\n",
		(x+y)*(x-y), (2.*x+y)^3;
</pre>
These output
<pre>
	1+5*x+10*x^2+10*x^3+5*x^4+x^5
	Answer: -y^2+x^2; y^3+6*x*y^2+12*x^2*y+8*x^3
</pre>
The first form just prints an expression followed by a newline.
In the second, extended, form, a format string is followed by a list
of expressions.  Each occurrence of <tt>%p</tt> in the format string
marks the position at which one of the expressions should be printed.
In the second form no newline is printed unless it occurs in the format string.

<p>Assignment statements come in a number of guises, the most straightforward
of which we've already seen:
<pre>
	p=(x+5)^4;
</pre>
As you surely have already figured out, this just stores the result of
evaluating the expression on the right of the <tt>=</tt> in a place
identified by the name on the left.
The other forms of assignment are just convenient abbreviations of
the straighforward form.  Here they are in a list, paired with the forms
that they abbreviate:

<pre>
	v+=e;	v=v+e;
	v-=e;	v=v-e;
	v*=e;	v=v*e;
	v/=e;	v=v/e;
	v^=e;	v=v^e;
	v++;	v=v+1;
	++v;	v=v+1;
	v--;	v=v-1;
	--v;	v=v-1;
</pre>

<p>compound

<p>if

<p>while

<p>do while

<p>for

<p>break

<p>continue

<h4>Syntax</h4>
<p>Below is a grammar, one production per line.
In the grammar, all punctuation characters and lower-case terms
are literal.  Terms in upper case are non-terminals.
NUM, VAR and STRING represent number, name and string tokens
and are not defined in the grammar.
Operator precedence from low to high is:
<pre>
	||
	&amp;&amp;
	&lt;= &lt; &gt;= &gt;
	== !=
	+ -	(binary)
	* /
	^	(right associative)
	+ -	(unary)
	[ ]	(right associative)
</pre>
All operators are left-associative
unless noted above, so  <tt>a-b+c</tt> means <tt>((a-b)+c)</tt>.
The productions given for <tt>if</tt> statements are ambiguous.
The resolution is, as usual, to tie each <tt>else</tt>
clause to the closest preceding unmatched <tt>if</tt>.
